# Understanding Quantrix

Quantrix Modeler (https://quantrix.com) is a multi-dimensional spreadsheet. Unlike traditional row/column spreadsheets, Quantrix organises data along named dimensions (categories).

## Core concepts

**Matrices** are the primary data containers — analogous to sheets, but inherently multi-dimensional. Each matrix has its own categories, items, and formulas.

**Categories** are named dimensions (e.g. "Year", "Region", "Product"). Each category contains **items** — the individual members. Categories can be shared across matrices, creating automatic linkage.

**Items** can be organised hierarchically into **groups** (referenced via dot notation, e.g. `Expenses.Travel`). Groups support `summary()` aggregation in formulas.

**Views** are how matrices are displayed — table layouts, charts, canvas arrangements. A matrix can have multiple views. Views are referenced by name with `::` separating the view from the cell reference.

**Formulas** are per-matrix, written in Quantrix's own formula language (not Groovy). Ordered — evaluation priority runs top to bottom.

**Scripts** are Groovy code ("QGroovy" when extended with pipe syntax). Action scripts run manually or on events; function scripts are callable from formulas.

## Formula syntax

```
[In scope,] LHS = RHS [using mappings] [skip exclusions]
```

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `Item = expr` | Assignment | `Total = A * B` |
| `: = expr` | All-cells assignment (LHS `:` = every intersection) | `: = sumproduct(A::, B::)` |
| `Matrix::Item` | Cross-matrix ref (specific item) | `Assumptions::Rate` |
| `Matrix::Category` | Cross-matrix ref (entire category/dimension) | `Revenue::Time` |
| `Matrix::` | Cross-matrix ref (whole matrix) | `Revenue::` |
| `Item1:Item2` | Intersection | `Budget:Total` |
| `Cat[THIS]`, `[PREV]`, `[~PREV]` | Positional (`~` = soft) | `Year[~PREV]` |
| `Cat[FIRST]`, `[LAST]` | Endpoints | `Year[LAST-1]` |
| `In Item, expr` | Context scoping | `In Units, Q[THIS] = ...` |
| `skip A, B` | Exclude items | `= X * Y skip Total` |
| `A .. B` | Range | `sum(A .. Z)` |
| `summary(Group)` | Group children | `sum(summary(Costs))` |
| `using A as B` | Dimension mapping | `using S::Year as Year` |
| `select(val, keys, match)` | Filtered lookup | `select(S::Qty, S::Mo, @Mo)` |
| `sumproduct(a, b)` | Element-wise multiply + sum over matched dims (positional, not by identity — dimensions need same size, not same category) | `sumproduct(A::, B::)` |

Operators: `+` `-` `*` `/` `^` `&` `==` `<>` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `#and#` `#or#` `#not#` `#true#` `#false#`

Comments: `//` line, `/* */` block.

### Formula scoping and eclipsing

**`In` scoping** is preferred when applying a formula to a subset of items. Compare:

- `In R1, : = sumproduct(A::, B::)` — clean, no warnings. Scopes the formula to R1, then `: =` assigns to all intersections within that scope.
- `R1 = sumproduct(A::, B::)` — works but warns *"Too few items from category Row specified on the left side"* because the RHS produces more dimensions than the LHS names.

**Eclipsing** occurs when two formulas have overlapping LHS targets without `skip` clauses. The later formula (higher index) wins for overlapping cells. The UI annotates this ("Eclipsed by 2" / "Eclipses 1") but this metadata is **not exposed** via the scripting API's `errorMessage` or `warningMessage`.

## Name quoting rules

Applies consistently across formulas, getSelection() strings, and pipe syntax.

**Unquoted names** may contain letters, digits (not first), and spaces. Must NOT contain:

```
! " # & ( ) * + , - . / ; < = > @ [ ] ^ { | } : \
```

Must not start with `$` or match keywords `skip`, `using`, `as` (case-insensitive).

**Quoted names** use single quotes, doubled for literal `'`:

```
'Long-term debt'           — hyphen
'2020'                     — starts with digit
'Shareholder''s Equity'    — apostrophe
'Name|Here'                — pipe character
```

## Cell reference syntax

- `::` separates **view/matrix name** from **coordinate**
- `:` separates **items from different categories**
- `..` defines a **range** between two coordinates
- `.` navigates **group hierarchy** (e.g. `Expenses.Travel`)

```
Matrix::ItemA:ItemB              — single cell
Matrix::A1:B1..A2:B2            — rectangular range
Matrix::*                        — all cells (no headers)
Matrix::^                        — all headers (no cells)
Matrix::Formula::1               — first formula
Matrix::                         — whole matrix (all dimensions)
Matrix::Category                 — a specific category/dimension within the matrix
```

In formulas, `Matrix::` and `Matrix::Category` are used for cross-matrix dimensional references. Quantrix auto-aligns on shared categories between the source and target matrices. `sumproduct()` multiplies element-wise and sums over dimensions not present in the target matrix, matching **positionally by size** — the contracted dimensions do not need to be the same (shared) category, just the same number of items. Using `Matrix::Category` explicitly names which dimension to operate on; `Matrix::` lets Quantrix infer it (works when unambiguous).

`getSelection()` accepts these strings:

```groovy
getSelection("Matrix::ItemA:ItemB").value
```

Object form — `matrix.getSelection(item, item, ...)` — takes `Item` objects directly, avoiding string building. Multiple items from the same category create a contiguous range (min to max by index).

## Pipe syntax (|...|)

In QGroovy scripts, pipe delimiters are shorthand for `getSelection()`:

```groovy
|Matrix::ItemA:ItemB|    →    getSelection("Matrix::ItemA:ItemB")
```

Recognised in code context only — not inside strings or comments. Cannot span lines. Opening `|` is disambiguated from bitwise OR using Groovy's regex-vs-division rules for `/`.

**Known limitation:** Quantrix's built-in pipe preprocessor (`AutoSelectionParser`) is a single regex that matches `|` inside strings and GString interpolation. Use `getSelection()` directly for reliable programmatic access.

## Formal grammars (EBNF)

Three EBNF grammars, inferred from Quantrix Modeler 24.4.0:

| Grammar | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| [name-and-reference.ebnf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jahs/quantrix-tools/main/skills/understanding-quantrix/references/name-and-reference.ebnf) | Names, quoting, coordinates, ranges, `::` resolution |
| [formula.ebnf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jahs/quantrix-tools/main/skills/understanding-quantrix/references/formula.ebnf) | Full formula language (superset of name-and-reference) |
| [pipe-selection.ebnf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jahs/quantrix-tools/main/skills/understanding-quantrix/references/pipe-selection.ebnf) | Pipe syntax within Groovy (subset of name-and-reference) |

Nesting is strict: valid pipe selection ⊂ valid reference ⊂ valid formula LHS. The [grammars.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jahs/quantrix-tools/main/skills/understanding-quantrix/references/grammars.md) covers implementation details and known discrepancies between Quantrix's three internal parsers.
